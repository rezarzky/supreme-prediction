# Supreme Court Oral Arguments Outcome Prediction

In this project, we propose a novel approach using natural language processing techniques to predict the outcomes of US Supreme Court cases based on oral argument transcripts. The aim is to understand how justices’ questions and comments might reveal their decision before it is officially issued. Our dataset was the Supreme Court Oral Arguments Corpus – more specifically, a subset across George W. Bush's and Barack Obama's administrations, which allowed for a comprehensive study across different political periods. Our model focused on the dialogues from cases that spanned 16 years under the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Features considered included text utterances, the percentage of Republican justices, the percentage of male justices, and the case development time. We found that Logistic Regression performs better in this dataset compared to other models. Despite an imbalanced dataset, our model demonstrated satisfactory performance using F1 scores as the measure, particularly highlighting the predictive power of text utterances.  This study faced limitations that opened avenues for future work, such as expanding the dataset and incorporating a wider array of features and advanced NLP methodologies
